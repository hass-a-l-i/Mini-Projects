# N shot learning is using N data points for one class to train
# N shot K way learning is using K classes with N data points each for classification
# # N shot aim is to make accurate models that can adapt to new classes with limited data
# a shot is an example basically that we use to train with
# is a form of transfer learning i.e. we train using N shot then apply to trained to diff class K (given data similar)
